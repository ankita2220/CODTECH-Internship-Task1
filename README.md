Project Description

The Todo List App is a web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to add tasks with due dates, mark tasks as completed, edit existing tasks, search for specific tasks, sort tasks alphabetically, and clear completed tasks. The app leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.


Features

Task Management: Users can add new tasks with due dates. Tasks are displayed in a list format with options to mark them as completed, edit their text, and delete tasks.

Task Interactivity: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks can be cleared using a dedicated button.

Sorting and Searching: Tasks can be sorted alphabetically and searched based on keywords entered into a search box.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.



 Functionality Overview

 

Add Task: Users input a task description and optionally set a due date. Clicking "Add Task" creates a new task in the list.

Edit Task: Double-clicking on a task allows users to edit its description inline.

Mark Task Complete: Clicking on a task marks it as completed, visually indicated by a checkbox icon.

Clear Completed Tasks: Removes all tasks that have been marked as completed from the list.

Search Tasks: Filters tasks based on user-entered keywords, showing only tasks that match the search criteria.

Sort Tasks: Arranges tasks alphabetically by their description.

Drag and Drop: Implements basic drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder tasks within the list.



Design and User Interface

Color Scheme: Uses a gradient background and clean, modern colors to enhance visual appeal and usability.
Typography: Employs the Poppins font for a clear and readable interface.
Icons: Utilizes FontAwesome icons for task completion status and various buttons.
Responsive Layout: Adjusts layout and functionality for optimal viewing and interaction on both desktop and mobile devices.
